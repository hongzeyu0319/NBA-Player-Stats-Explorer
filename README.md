# NBA Players Stats Explorer

The NBA Players Stats Explorer is an interactive tool designed to allow users to explore NBA player statistics and compare players using Binary Search Tree (BST) structures.

This project accesses data from the NBA stats website and the NBA Stats API to create a dataset containing player information, team information, and various statistics (e.g., points, rebounds, assists, etc.). Additionally, the program scrapes player stats pages from Basketball-Reference to augment the dataset.

By building BST tree structures based on user-selected criteria (e.g., points per game, assists per game, etc.), the NBA Players Stats Explorer enables users to compare players and visualize the trees.
