# NBA stats search

The goal of this project is to provide an interactive tool that allows users to explore NBA player statistics and compare players using tree structures. 

The program will access data from the NBA stats website and the NBA Stats API to create a dataset that contains player information, team information, and various statistics (e.g., points, rebounds, assists, etc.). The program will also scrape player stats pages from Basketball-Reference to augment the dataset. 

The program will then build tree structures of player statistics based on user-selected criteria (e.g., points per game, assists per game, etc.) and allow users to compare players by visualizing the trees.
